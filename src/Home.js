            <p id="commitment">Originally from Oregon, now residing in St John's Florida, I have worked as a professional in the beauty industry since I graduated Portland Beauty School in 2014. My specialties include and are not limited to, hair color, balayage, and menâ€™s cuts.<br></br><br></br>
            I enjoy furthering my education with as many classes as I can attend. I'm dedicated to keeping up with the latest styles and trends in the world of fashion and design, so that I can create any look my client desires. <br></br><br></br>
            I enjoy a personal and caring relationship with all my clients and my goal is for each of my guest to feel pampered and relaxed during their appointment.<br></br><br></br>
